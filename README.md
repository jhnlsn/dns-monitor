dns-monitor
===========

# Summary
monitors dns resolves
Not very useful right now, I am just trying to move
some of my public work to github from a private svn repo.

You will need to add xbill DNS to your project classpath manually to build.
Also org.json.me as well

# TODO
Remove xbill.DNS source files

Update to use hopper

Don't have a build file yet either.
